# Personal Data Chatbot for Recruiters

This project is a custom-built chatbot designed to provide detailed responses based on my personal data, tailored specifically for recruiters. The chatbot is trained using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model built with PyTorch and utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) through the NLTK library. The chatbot can understand and respond to queries using the information Iâ€™ve provided.

## Features
- **Personalized Responses**: The chatbot is trained on data related to my skills, experience, and projects to give recruiters detailed answers to relevant questions.
- **Machine Learning**: Built using a PyTorch RNN model to process input text and generate responses.
- **NLP Integration**: Uses the NLTK library to process and understand natural language queries.
- **Web Application**: The project features a web interface built with React for the frontend and Django for the backend.
- **WhatsApp Bot**: The same model is integrated with a WhatsApp bot using Twilio services for easy access and interaction via messaging.

## Technologies Used
- **PyTorch (RNN)**: For training and developing the machine learning model.
- **NLTK**: To process natural language queries.
- **Django**: Backend framework to handle API requests and responses.
- **React**: Frontend framework for building a user-friendly interface.
- **Twilio API**: To integrate the chatbot with WhatsApp for seamless messaging services.
